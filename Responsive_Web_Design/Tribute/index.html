        <p>"Perfectly balanced as all things should be."</p>
        <p>"Reality is often disappointing."</p>
        <p>"I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless."</p>
        <p>"Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same."</p>
        
        <p>"Little one it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite. It's resources are finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist."</p>
        
        <p>"A small price to pay for salvation."</p>
        <p>"I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again."</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry little one."</p>
        <p>"They called me a madman."
        <p>"The hardest choices require the strongest wills."</p>
        <p>"Today I have lost more than you could know. But now is not the time to mourn."</p>
        <p>"...it was never personal."</p>
        <p>"...but this.. does put a smile on my face."</p>
        <p>"You could not live with your own failure."</p>
        <p>"As long as there are those who remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist."</p>
